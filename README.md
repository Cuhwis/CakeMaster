## Introduction
# Cake Master - MSSA project 
Cake Master is a web application designed for my parent's cake business. Currently my father does every order with phone calls and 
paperwork. Keeping track of past orders and new orders is a on going problem with my parents. Creating this application will improve
their organization of archiving orders while reducing the need of having to rely on paperwork. This is also created for customers to

for the customer to view in another page to keep an eye on their order.
