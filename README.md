## Introduction
# Cake Master - MSSA project 
Cake Master is a web application designed for my parent's cake business. Currently my father does every order with phone calls and 
paperwork. Keeping track of past orders and new orders is a on going problem with my parents. Creating this application will improve

for the customer to view in another page to keep an eye on their order.
